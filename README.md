📊 **PRODIGY_DS_03 – Bank Marketing Prediction Using Decision Tree**

This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a client will **subscribe to a term deposit** based on the Bank Marketing Dataset. The code performs data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizes the confusion matrix.

### 🔍 Key Features:

* **Data Preprocessing**

  * Label encoding of categorical features
  * Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

* **Model Building**

  * Decision Tree Classifier with `entropy` criterion and `max_depth=5`
  * Evaluation using Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix

* **Visualization**

  * Heatmap of Confusion Matrix using Seaborn

### 📁 Dataset File Used:

* `bank.csv`
* 📌 Source: [Kaggle - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset)

---

### 📊 Visual Outputs:

* Confusion Matrix Heatmap
* Classification Report with precision, recall, F1-score
